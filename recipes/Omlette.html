    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>An American omelette is a hearty, golden-brown egg dish typically stuffed with a combination of cheese,
         vegetables, and sometimes meat. To make it, start by whisking 2–3 eggs in a bowl with a pinch of salt 
         and pepper until fully blended. Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat and melt a small knob of butter 
         or add a splash of oil. Pour in the eggs and let them cook undisturbed for a few seconds until the edges 
         begin to set. Using a spatula, gently lift the edges and tilt the pan to allow the uncooked egg to flow 
         underneath. This helps ensure an evenly cooked and fluffy texture.</p>

    <p>When the eggs are mostly set but still slightly soft on top, sprinkle your choice of fillings—shredded cheese,
         diced bell peppers, onions, mushrooms, or cooked ham—over one half of the omelette. Carefully fold the other 
         half over the fillings and let it cook for another 30 seconds to a minute until the cheese melts and the center
          is warmed through. Slide the omelette onto a plate and serve hot, optionally garnished with herbs or a side of
           toast or breakfast potatoes. The American omelette is as flexible as it is satisfying, making it a perfect 
           breakfast or brunch option.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2–3 large eggs</li>
        <li>Salt, to taste</li>
        <li>Black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter or cooking oil</li>
        <li>¼ cup shredded cheese (cheddar, American, or your favorite)</li>
        <li>¼ cup diced bell peppers</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped onions</li>
        <li>¼ cup sliced mushrooms (optional)</li>
        <li>¼ cup cooked ham or bacon bits (optional)</li>
        <li>Fresh herbs like parsley or chives, for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Dice the vegetables and cook any meats if needed; grate the cheese and set everything aside.</li>
        <li>Crack 2–3 eggs into a bowl, add a pinch of salt and black pepper, and whisk until fully combined and slightly frothy.</li>
        <li>Place a non-stick skillet over medium heat and add 1 tablespoon of butter or oil, allowing it to melt and coat the pan evenly.</li>
        <li>Pour the beaten eggs into the skillet and let them sit for a few seconds as the edges begin to set.</li>
        <li>Use a spatula to gently lift the edges of the omelette, tilting the pan so uncooked egg flows underneath. Continue until the eggs are mostly set but still soft on top.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the shredded cheese, diced vegetables, and cooked meat (if using) over one half of the omelette.</li>
        <li>Carefully fold the omelette in half over the fillings and let it cook for another 30 seconds to 1 minute until the cheese melts and the inside is hot.</li>
        <li>Slide the omelette onto a plate and serve immediately, optionally garnished with fresh herbs.</li>
    </ol>
