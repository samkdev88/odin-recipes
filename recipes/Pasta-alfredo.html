    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken Alfredo is a rich and creamy pasta dish that combines tender slices of 
        chicken breast with a velvety Parmesan cheese sauce served over fettuccine noodles. 
        To prepare it, start by seasoning boneless, skinless chicken breasts with salt, 
        pepper, and optionally garlic powder. Cook the chicken in a skillet with a bit of 
        olive oil over medium heat until golden brown and fully cooked through, then set 
        it aside to rest before slicing. In the same pan, melt butter and sauté minced 
        garlic until fragrant. Add heavy cream and bring it to a gentle simmer, then stir 
        in freshly grated Parmesan cheese, whisking until the sauce becomes smooth and creamy.</p>

    <p>While the sauce simmers, boil a pot of salted water and cook the fettuccine until al dente. 
        Drain the pasta and add it to the Alfredo sauce, tossing until the noodles are evenly coated. 
        Add the sliced chicken back into the pan and stir to combine everything. If the sauce is too 
        thick, a splash of reserved pasta water can help loosen it. Finish with a sprinkle of parsley 
        or extra cheese on top. Chicken Alfredo is comforting, indulgent, and simple to make—perfect 
        for a cozy dinner or special occasion.</p>
