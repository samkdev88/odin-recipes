        <h1>Spaghetti</h1>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>To make a classic spaghetti dish, start by boiling a large pot of salted water. 
            Once it reaches a rolling boil, add the spaghetti noodles and cook them according 
            to the package instructions until they are al dente. While the pasta is cooking, 
            heat olive oil in a separate pan over medium heat. Add finely chopped onions and 
            garlic, sautéing until they're soft and fragrant. Then, stir in ground beef or 
            Italian sausage (optional), cooking until browned. Once the meat is cooked, pour 
            in crushed tomatoes or tomato sauce, season with salt, pepper, and Italian herbs 
            like basil and oregano, and let the sauce simmer for 15–20 minutes to develop flavor.</p>
        <p>When the spaghetti is ready, drain it and combine it with the sauce, tossing everything 
            together until the noodles are well coated. For a richer taste, you can add a splash 
            of pasta water to loosen the sauce or stir in a bit of grated Parmesan cheese. Garnish 
            with fresh basil or parsley before serving. This simple yet flavorful dish is a staple 
            of Italian cuisine and can be easily adapted to suit vegetarian or spicy preferences by 
            swapping ingredients or adding red pepper flakes. Serve hot with garlic bread and a side 
            salad for a complete meal.</p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill a large pot with water, add a generous pinch of salt, and bring it to a rolling boil.</li>
            <li>Add 400g (14 oz) spaghetti noodles, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking.</li>
            <li>Cook according to the package instructions until al dente, usually 8–10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Reserve about ½ cup of pasta water, then drain the spaghetti and set it aside.</li>
            <li>In a large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Add 1 finely chopped onion and sauté for 3–4 minutes until soft and translucent.</li>

            <li>Bring the sauce to a gentle simmer and cook uncovered for 15–20 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>

            <li>Stir in ¼ cup of grated Parmesan cheese (optional) for extra richness.</li>
