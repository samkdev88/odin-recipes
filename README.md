In this project, I will apply the HTML skills Iâ€™ve learned to build a basic recipe website. The site will include a main index page that links to several individual recipe pages. While the design will remain simple for now, the primary goal is to strengthen my understanding of HTML structure, elements, and linking between pages. Upon completion, I will have demonstrated my ability to create a multi-page website using semantic HTML.
